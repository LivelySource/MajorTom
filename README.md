# Starter Bot
A fork of [AnIdiotsGuide](https://github.com/AnIdiotsGuide) template discord bot, named [Guide Bot](https://github.com/AnIdiotsGuide/guidebot), I've custom made this to make my own version of a template for a discord bot.

## Downloading

In a command prompt in your projects folder (wherever that may be) run the following:

`git clone https://github.com/GracefulKnight/StarterBot.git`

Once Finished:

- In the folder from where you ran the git command, run `cd startbot` and then run `npm install`
- Rename or copy `config.js.example` to `data/config.js`
- Edit `data/config.js` and fill in all the relevant details as indicated in the file's comments.

## Starting the bot

To start the bot, in the command prompt, run the following command:
`node main.js`
